Tom uses an algorithm to decide which website will he visit today. The website begins with address like Mindturner/solve/... but he doesnt remember what came after the '/'. What he does remember is the algorithm. The next letters in the link are given by the following algo:
Rule 1:   The digits in that days date (dd/mm/yy) appear in the link. One digit appears exactly once
Rule 2:   The rest characters are letters of the english alphabet and on rearranging forms a meaningful word
Rule 3:   If the date is odd, the digits take up odd places and are in the ascending order. If date is even, they are in even places and are in descending order
Rule 4:   The letters are always distinct
Rule 5:   Total no. of permutations of the link trail (considering no constraints) is 40320
Rule 6:   The word formed by the letters is the name of a software. Tom uses the software daily!
Rule 7:   Interestingly, the name is such that the letters of the proper noun when written in computer code are in the order of increasing ascii values
Rule 8:   The arrangement in the link is such that the letters are arranged first and the digits fill the gap. Digit may begin if the date is odd and the next gaps are compulsorily filled till we run out of digits. If date is even, the largest digit ends the link. The letters are put alphabetically
Help Tom access the website.

A long time ago in a galaxy far away, on a strange planet there were N kingdoms numbered 1 to N. Each kingdom had a jack, queen and a king who either said something good or something bad. The following is what goes on on this planet:
1. At the fall of each cannon ball in the kingdom, its queen makes a statement. She would say something good if and only if:
-- The jack said something good that day and the queen said something bad the previous day. OR
-- The king said something bad that day and the queen said something good the previous day.
2. Whenever the queen of a (Mth) kingdom makes a bad statement immediately after a good one, the people get angry and fire a cannon into the next(M+1 th) kingdom.
3. Since this gives an undue advantage to kingdom 1, the evil galactic empire has placed a cannon before it which fires each day no matter what.
One day a special meet was called after which the jacks and kings decided to say good things always. On this day all N queens happened to give a bad statement.
After 4095 days, you happen to notice that all the queens are saying a good statement. What is the sum of all possible values of N?
ans) 78
